This is a first draft Arduino project to enable lego technic electrics control from arduino via a homebrew shield developed by willem Godlieb.

Lego_Shield_Willem: has all the basic functionality and was tested on the populated PCB, it takes serial monitor input (not BT).
Lego_auto_test1 is a bit more advanced and will allow BT connections from phones.
